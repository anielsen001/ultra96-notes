#+TITLE: Ultra96 working notes

The Ultra96 board is made by Avnet. All of these notes refer to the V2.

* Getting started

This [[https://www.96boards.org/documentation/consumer/ultra96/ultra96-v2/getting-started/][96boards page]] has some getting started information. As of <2019-10-18 Fri> the board also ships with a [[http://zedboard.org/sites/default/files/documentations/5365-QSC-ultra96-v2-v3.pdf][printed insert]] and there is an [[http://zedboard.org/sites/default/files/documentations/Ultra96-V2-GSG-v1_1.pdf][Avnet gettng]] started guide that has conflicting information.
Specifically the insert mentions that the included MicroSD card is not formatted,
while the website says that is pre-flashed and boots linux. The printed insert is 
correct. The MicroSD card is not formatted at all. Download the [[http://avnet.me/ultra96-v2-oob][MicroSD card image]] 
to get started.

Unzip and find a pdf with instructions and a disk image. Avnet recommends using 
[[https://www.balena.io/etcher/][Etcher]] to make the disk image, so I tried it, following the instructions on 
[[https://github.com/balena-io/etcher#debian-and-ubuntu-based-package-repository-gnulinux-x86x64][their github page for Ubuntu]]. Etcher (run as balena-etcher-electron) is very easy to use, definitely faster than
using dd.

I also discovered along the way that there are sometimes issues reading a MicroSD card
through an adaptor on some computer SD card slots. The reader on my laptop has
these issues, but I can use a USB SD card reader without incident. 

The photos on the webpage of the board and the described location of the power button
also differ from the insert. The insert matches the [[images/ultra96v2_photo.jpg][board]] I received.
